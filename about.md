The final product should
------

* Read EDF files
* Process and filter data from EDF files
* Visualize the processed data and display it in the browser

Difficulties in creating a single product that met the requirements forced us to break it down into two seperate projects

* The main project can read EDF files, and visualize a single signal at a time in the browser. It processes data from EDF files and streams the data , but the signal processing is limited and does not fulfil all the requirements of the project.
* A seperate project can process, filter and visualize a signal. It can only do so with a dynamically generated sine curve as we didn't have time to implement it in the main project.
