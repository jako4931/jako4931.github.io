# [](#header-1)EDF filer'

**A brief walk-through of problems that arose while getting data from Edf files, and reasoning for changing the approach from writing our own modules from scratch to using existing libraries.**

The focus for the second sprint was to take signal data extrapolated from an Edf file and plot them out, and getting the file reader to work more efficiently. The first sprint was a little weird for the sake of the team working together on almost everything that we did. That did not apply as much in the second sprint. For the second sprint we split up the backlog items, and a team member spent most of the time looking at possible solutions to a problem that came up.

Other members in my group went on to visualize the signals, while I looked at the performance of the Edf reader that we had built previously.

The first main challenge was rewriting the logic where the signals are read from the file and appended into arrays of data points. Everything functioned as it should and the output was valid, but the execution time for the process was insanely high, especially with larger files.

Up until this point I had tested the code with smaller files. When I tried to process a significantly larger file with the same code the results were the following:
