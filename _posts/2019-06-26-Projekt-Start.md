# [](#header-1)A short overview over the first sprint.

The first sprint of this project revolved around getting to know and understand the EDF file format, as well as reading the information that is stored in the file header. Group members had little to no previous experience with the python programming language, nor any of the other tools we set up to use in this project except for git and github, so we chose to be very careful with estimating what we were going to get done in the first sprint. Having fewer items in the backlog allowed us to focus on learning how to use the tools, and gave us time to look at the project as a whole and how we want to proceed after the first sprint is over.

We work with Scrum, and one of my favorite things about Scrum is the burndown chart. When the team plans a sprint, each item in the sprint backlog will get a time estimate. When that item has been done, the time which it took to finish it is written down and then a comparison chart is made, which helps give overview over if the project is on schedule or not.

The first sprint will most likely differ from the following ones as the group worked more or less together on everything we did this sprint. We decided to start the project working this way as group members lacked experience with the programming language and the tools we used. Because of that, the group can be sure that the other members are on the same page when we talk about the basic components of the system we are developing, and that all group members can read the code and understand what is happening.
